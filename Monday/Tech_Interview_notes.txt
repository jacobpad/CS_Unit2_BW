Describing Code in an Interview
-------------------------------

Either:
* Something you already wrote
* Something you have to write on the spot


RELAX
-----
I pretend I already have the job.
Interviewer is a coworker that came to me for help.

Puts you in a helping/teaching mindset.

Changes things to be a bit more "cooperative".
    Employers love teamwork.

Don't be afraid to explore the problem.
    Think out loud.


Teach the problem to the interviewer
------------------------------------

UPER!

Understand:
    Explain the problem to the interviewer
        In your own words

Plan:
    This is where all the work is.

    If you already wrote the code:
        Compare multiple solutions that you came up with
    Else:
        Come up with multiple solutions
        Choose one of them

    Explain the big conceptual/logical pieces of project
        
Execute:
    If you already wrote the code:
        Go over the code you wrote
    Else:
        Implement the plan

Reflect:
    If you already wrote the code:
        If you thought of anything else to improve it, share it.
        Come up with future improvements.

    Else:
        Look for additional approaches.
        Come up with future improvements.
